1. MvCommand - make improvements to cmd
    - move multiple files (could add args for mv if used, allow multiple files)
    - move to a remote drive/pc
     Filesystem / Utility
2. HelpCommand - make imvprovement -> help <cmd>

// NOTE:
Apart from the current functionality of the commands, the args/flags and the process of using them will have to be refined

// NOTE:
Error coming from commands should be focusing on commands being failed.
If I have to read the cur wd while using touch cmd for example, if reading the wd fails, I shouldn't be returning an error that tells that touch failed cause it failed to read dirs as. But I'll have to think about that.

// NOTE:
When using touch, if a file already exists, the cmd will ask you if you'd like to overwrite the file. Command works as intended, but the problem is that after you hit Y or N, the cwd will be printed twice in the same line
DONE: Implemented another return as bool for supressing the cwd prompt in case Y/N is used.
In the main.go, Scanner was picking up \n leftover from Y/N and starting the loop again which in turn printed the cwd twice.

Possible additions:
1. tree
    Print the directory structure.
2. touch DONE:
    Create a new empty file
3. cp TODO: work on overwriting the files Y/N question as in touch
    Copy files. 
4. head / tail
    Show the first or last N lines of a file.
5. grep
    Search for a string inside files.
6. wc
    Count lines, words, or bytes in a file.
7. count
    Custom version of wc with total file count, file type stats, etc.
8. find
    Find a file by name.
9. clear
    Clears the terminal.
10. history
    List previous commands during this session.
11. alias
    Save shortcuts for longer commands (like ls -a â†’ ll).
12. prompt
    Change the CLI prompt (e.g. from cwd > to something custom).
