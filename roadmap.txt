Apart from the current functionality of the commands, the args/flags and the process of using them will have to be refined

// NOTE:
Error coming from commands should be focusing on commands being failed.
If I have to read the cur wd while using touch cmd for example, if reading the wd fails, I shouldn't be returning an error that tells that touch failed cause it failed to read dirs as. But I'll have to think about that.
